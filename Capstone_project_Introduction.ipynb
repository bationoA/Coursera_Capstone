    "Creating business in private sector has become more attractive for millions of people. Working in public in public sector is great and it has its advantages. But, for many reasons (dreams, wealthiness, etc) many people aspire to have their own business. \n",
    "When starting a business, it worth to have some knowledge about the place in order to make better choice. It’s also important to have info about needs and the successful existing business to have an idea about what people likes and uses frequently. The target population will a subset of the G7 countries.\n",

    "_“The Group of Seven <b>(G7)</b> is an international intergovernmental economic organization consisting of seven major developed countries: <b>Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom and the United States</b>, which are the largest IMF-advanced economies in the world”_ (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_of_Seven). In this project, the interest will be on the type of business/venues that exist in the G7 countries, categorize each country according to the most widespread type of venues that they have and then categorize venues by taking all the G7 countries as a whole. This project could a pretty good starting point for people who are willing to have create a new venue as business in one of the G7 countries. Indeed, they will be able to know which kind of venues exist in a particular country or town, which kind of venues are more common, use our model to predict in which type of venue their business will fall in and so, better identify the competition and have an idea on how likely their new business will be well received by the population."
